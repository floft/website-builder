Floft Website Builder
=====================
I created this content management system (CMS) back around 2008. The last time
I updated it was 2009. Thus, don't actually use this thing. I used it for a few
websites I managed back then before switching to Drupal, then
[flowgen](https://github.com/floft/flowgen) static HTML site, then finally
Jekyll on Github Pages.

First I'd copy the *installer* over to the site, which would download the *CMS*
from the update server (see *update_server*). Be warned that this is an
insecure method of doing updates. If you wanted to test this, you can copy
*CMS* and ignore the installer and update server.

Here's a screenshot of what it looked like:
