<h2>Twitter Plugin</h2>
<b>Username</b><br />
The Twitter Plugin allows you to take some status messages and display them on the page. In order to use this plugin you must already have a twitter account. For the most simple way to use this plugin, all you have to do is type your username (such as "floft") into the Username box and click Save.<br /><br />
<b>Other URL</b><br />
If you decide to download a cache of the twitter file from http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/<i>USERNAME</i>.xml?count=10 (replace <i>USERNAME</i> with your username), you can paste the url of the cache file into the Other URL box. You can change the count (set to 10 in this example) if you want to have more status messages shown. If you do this, you don't need to type in your username.<br /><br />
<b>Number of Statuses (per page)</b><br />
If you decide you don't want the default of ten statuses per page, you can set the number to something else here (e.g. 75). This will only change anything if there are enough status messages to take up more than one page (if there are mor e than this number or the default of ten status updates).<br /><br />
