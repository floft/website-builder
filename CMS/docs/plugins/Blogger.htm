<h2>Blogger Plugin</h2>
<b>Blogger feed url</b><br />
An example is given next to this: http://example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default. Type this into the box if you are using Blogger for your blog and replace the <i>example.blogspot.com</i> with your username dot blogspot dot com.<br /><br />
<b>Blogg feed url to link to</b><br />
This can be any other feed link for example if you want a feedburner link, or this can be the same as the one above. You can also leave this blank if you don't want a link to the RSS Feed.<br /><br />
<b>Subscribe to by email</b><br />
This was created so there can be a link to the page FeedBurner uses to allow people to subscribe to your blog by email. If you don't use feedburner, this is pretty much useless. If you do, you can type in the email link here. It should look something like: http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=floft/garrett&amp;loc=en_US.<br /><br />
