<h2>Questions Plugin</h2>
<b>Warning</b>: you will need to edit the <i>access.php</i> file so that you get the email instead of me. Also you probably want to change my name to your name.<br /><br />
When you go to this plugin's page you will see absolutely nothing. In order to use this plugin you must first add it to a page by putting &lt;plugin:Questions&gt;. Then go to that page and you will see no questions at all, but also a place for a person to add questions. Once somebody adds a question you will get an email telling you what page to go to (make sure you are logged in when you go to this page). You can anwser the question and when you submit it the other person will get an email saying you answered it. Also both the question and the answer will appear on the page the plugin id displayed on.<br /><br /><a href="javascript:history.back(-1);">Back</a></body></html>
