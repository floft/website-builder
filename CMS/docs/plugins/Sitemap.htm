<h2>Sitemap.txt Plugin</h2>
The first step in using this plugin is creating a page and putting the plugin on it by typing in &lt;plugin:sitemap.txt&gt;. You will want to set the page up so that the design will not be displayed. Once you do this you can go to the plugin's administration page and edit the settings.<br /><br />
There will be a blank text box. This is where you put all your pages. Here is an example page:<br />
<blockquote>#the menu for the site<br />
&lt;menu&gt;<br />
#two pages that aren't on the menu, but i still want them in the sitemap<br />
&lt;site&gt;Updates<br />
&lt;site&gt;Legal</blockquote>
This is actually the sitemap I use on my site. It will have all the menu items and the two other pages that are listed at the bottom. As you can see, comments can also be inserted by starting them with a pound/number sign.<br /><br />
