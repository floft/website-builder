<h2>Edit a Page</h2>
Click on the "Edit a Page" link to edit a page. Once you are there you will see a list of all your pages. Click on the "Edit" link next to the page you want to edit.<br /><br />
You will see two links at the top of the page: View Page and View Stats. Clicking on the "View Page" link will show you what the current page you are editing looks like. The "View Stats" link will show you how many people have gone to the page you are editing.<br /><br />
Below the links will be the name of the page and the URL of the page (if you are using <a href="prettyurls.htm">Pretty URLs</a>). If you are not editing the homepage and you are using Pretty URLs, you will be able to change the URL of the page. Under that you can choose whether you want the page on the menubar and whether or not you want to show the design on this page (useful for certian plugins like a sitemap.txt file). Then, you can insert a meta description and meta keywords.<br /><br />
Below all of this is the most important part of the page: where you actually edit the page. You will either see the TinyMCE editor or the HTML code for your page depending on what you set up in the "Edit Settings" page (see <a href="editconfig.htm">Edit Config</a>). When you have finished editing the page, click the "Save" button to save your changes.<br /><br />
<b>Special Characters</b><br />
You will be able to add special characters to your code if you are editing the HTML code. Here is the list of all the special characters you can use:<blockquote>
	<i>&lt;plugin:<u>plugin name</u>&gt;</i> - This inserts the plugin (to find the plugin name, view the plugin options and it will show it).<br />
	<i>&lt;get:<u>name</u>&gt;</i> - This will get <u>name</u> from the query string (gets something from the $_REQUEST variable).<br />
	<i>&lt;server:<u>name</u>&gt;</i> - This gets <u>name</u> from the server variable ($_SERVER).<br />
	<i>&lt;url:uploads&gt;</i> - This will insert the URL to all of your uploads (normally: <i>http://www.example.com/uploads/0/</i>).<br />
	<i>&lt;url:homepage&gt;</i> - This will insert the URL of your hompeage (e.g. <i>http://garrett.floft.net/Home</i>).<br />
	<i>&lt;url:theme&gt;</i> - This will insert the URL of your theme directory (normally: <i>http://www.example.com/themes/0/</i>).<br />
	<i>&lt;stats:site&gt;</i>  - This will insert the total number of people who have gone to your website.<br />
	<i>&lt;stats:current&gt;</i>  - This will insert the total number of people who have to the current page.
