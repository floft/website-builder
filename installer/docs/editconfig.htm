<h2>Edit Config</h2>
If you decide you want to change how you edit a page, you can do this by going to the "Edit Settings" page. At the top of the page you will see two options: WYSIWYG Editor and Edit HTML. If you select the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) Editor you will use TinyMCE to edit your pages. If you select Edit HTML you will edit the HTML directly.
