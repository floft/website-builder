<h2>About Administration</h2>
To get to the administration page, you must first login. Go to <i>yoursite.com/admin</i>. On my site, I would go to <i>http://garrett.floft.net/admin</i>. Once you have arrived at the login screen, type in your username and password and click "Login." Below are all the pages you will be able to go to.<br /><br />
<b>Menu</b><br />
The menu will be on the left-hand side of the administration page. To go to a page, click on the link.<br /><br />
<b>The Dashboard</b><br />
You will now see "The Dashboard" page which will have a link to your website and it will tell you if there is a new version of the Floft Website Builder available.<br /><br />
<b>Create a Page</b><br />
This page will allow you to create a new page. Note: your homepage already exists.<br /><br />
<b>Delete a Page</b><br />
This page will allow you to delete the pages you have already created. Be careful when doing this; these pages can not be recovered.<br /><br />
<b>Edit a Page</b><br />
If you want to edit a page you have already created, click this link. You will be able to either use the TinyMCE editor or edit the HTML code for the page (to change this go to the "Edit Settings" page).<br /><br />
<b>Edit the Links</b><br />
This page will show you all the links on the menu bar and allow you to change the order. You will also be able to reset the order.<br /><br />
<b>Edit the Footer</b><br />
This page will show the current footer and allow you to edit it by using either the TinyMCE editor or by editing the HTML code.<br /><br />
<b>Edit Error Page</b><br />
This page will display the error page. This page will be displayed to a user when they try to access a page that does not exist. You will be able to edit this by using either the TinyMCE editor or by editing the HTML code directly.<br /><br />
<b>View Uploads</b><br />
This page will show you all of the files you have uploaded to your website. You will be able to delete, rename, and change whether or not they are executable.<br />
<b>Upload Something</b><br />
This page allows you to upload more files to your website. If you want to upload a file larger than the set limit, you must edit the <i>variables.php</i> file and change the max upload size.<br /><br />
<b>Pages only show if you have "Members" enabled on the "Themes" page:</b>
<blockquote>
	<b>Members</b><br />
	This page will show you all the members of your site, their username, name, and email address. It will also allow you to send a new user an activation email and allow you to delete a user.<br /><br />
	<b>Edit Member Links</b><br />
	This page is just like the "Edit the Links" page, but you will be editing the links for Members Only pages.<br /><br />
	<b>Edit Login Form</b><br />
	This will enable you to edit the text that is shown above the login form.<br /><br />
	<b>Create Account Text</b><br />
	This page shows you the text that is shown above the "Create an Account" form on the page. To view this, click the "View Page" link.
</blockquote>
<b>Themes</b><br />
This page allows you to install and delete themes. Once you have installed a theme, you can select it and chose the options that go along with it.<br /><br />
<b>Plugins</b><br />
This page allows you to install and delete plugins. When you have plugins installed, you can click on the link (e.g. "Pictures") and edit the settings for that plugin, if any are available. Warning: plugins can do anything including delete your entire website, so be careful when you use plugins.<br /><br />
<b>Site Stats</b><br />
This page allows you to see how many people have gone to your website. To see how many people have gone to each individual page, click on the "View Stats" link next to the page.<br /><br />
<b>Data Backup</b><br />
Sometimes you might want to backup the databse. When you want to do this, go to this page and click the link to download a dump of your website content. Note: none of your uploads, themes, or plugins will be download.<br /><br />
<b>Logout</b><br />
This will log you out of the administration page. Use this when you are done editing/configuring your website.<br /><br />
<b>My Account</b><br />
You can edit your name, email address, username and password on this page if you ever want to change them.<br /><br />
<b>Edit Settings</b><br />
This page will allow you to change your settings. It will allow you to change whether you want to edit the pages using just plain HTML code or by using the TinyMCE (WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get) editor. Also, you can choose whether you want the default looking URLs or "Pretty URLs." Note: pretty URLs require Apache since it uses a <i>.htaccess</i> file.
