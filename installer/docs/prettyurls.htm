<h2>Pretty URLs</h2>
You have two options when it comes to URLs: you can either have URLs that look like <i>http://www.example.com/index.php?id=1</i> or <i>http://www.example.com/Home</i>. The latter is using Pretty URLs. This requires Apache since it is using a <i>.htaccess</i> file.<br /><br />
If you decide you want to use Pretty URLs, go to the administration page and click on "Edit Settings." The second setting will ask you what you want your URLs to look like. Choose the second option if you decide to try out Pretty URLs.
